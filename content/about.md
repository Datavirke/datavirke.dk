With more than five years of experience working as both a Software Engineer and in Operations & Infrastructure, I have keen insights into not only the unique challenges associated with each discipline, but importantly also the contact point between them.

As a **[Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.credly.com/badges/ff992521-0a3b-4b0f-a165-b3e4a0ca588e/public_url)** I have advised on, built, and maintained numerous Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers, produced several Kubernetes Operators, among them one for managing [DNS Records](https://github.com/orgs/kubi-zone/repositories) as regular Custom Resources, as well as [developed](https://github.com/MathiasPius/kronform) and [documented](https://datavirke.dk/tags/kubernetes/) the setup of a self-sufficient cluster running solely on large bare-metal hardware.

As a **DevOps Consultant** I have containerized and pipelined everything from complex processes targeting proprietary hardware to modern web applications, designed and implemented CI/CD workflows in environments with very tight constraints and many stakeholders, as well as architected and implemented deployments to AWS using cloud-native services to achieve high availability.

As a **Software Engineer** I have authored a [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/MathiasPius/zfs/0.5.0) in Go for configuring ZFS filesystems using Infrastructure-as-Code tools, written API client libraries for managing [Hetzner Dedicated Servers](https://crates.io/crates/hrobot), implemented a [Language Server](https://github.com/MathiasPius/crates-lsp) compiled to WASM for checking dependency updates to Rust projects, and much, much [more](https://github.com/MathiasPius?tab=repositories).

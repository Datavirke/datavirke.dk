As a consequence of my intense curiosity about all the layers of abstraction that modern technologies are comprised of,
as well as the incredible speed with which entire areas and job titles within the IT profession come and go,
I have worn many hats throughout my career.

Below I have captured a small subset of my professional achievements

As a **[Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.credly.com/badges/ff992521-0a3b-4b0f-a165-b3e4a0ca588e/public_url)** I have:

* Advised on, built, and maintained _many_ Kubernetes clusters across Hetzner, AWS and other public clouds.
* Authored several Kubernetes Operators like [kubi-zone](https://kubi.zone) for Kubernetes-native DNS management.
* [Developed](https://github.com/MathiasPius/kronform) and [documented](https://datavirke.dk/tags/kubernetes/) the setup of a self-sufficient cluster running solely on large bare-metal hardware.

---

As a **Platform Engineer** I have:
* Applied concepts like [SSOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) and [Make Illegal States Unrepresentable](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/) to domains modelling.
* Designed reentrant self-service processes state machines for minimal downtime and maximum resilience.
* Worked closely with platform consumers to understand and automate fragile processes.

---

As a **Software Engineer** I have:
* Written API client libraries for managing [Hetzner Dedicated Servers](https://crates.io/crates/hrobot) safely.
* Authored a [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/MathiasPius/zfs) in Go for configuring ZFS filesystems using Infrastructure-as-Code tools.
* Implemented a [Language Server](https://github.com/MathiasPius/crates-lsp) targting WASM for dependency management in Rust projects.

---

As a **DevOps Engineer** I have:
* Architected and implemented deployments to cloud-native AWS services using Infrastructure as Code.
* Containerized everything from complex processes targeting proprietary hardware to modern web applications.
* Designed and implemented CI/CD in environments with very tight constraints and many stakeholders.
